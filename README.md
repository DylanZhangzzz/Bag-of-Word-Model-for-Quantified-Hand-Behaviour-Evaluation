The main contributions of this work are summarised as follows:
We bridge two metrics for hand motion evaluation from psychology research to ASD-related traits. We propose a deep learning-based sequential bag of convolutional features (SBoCF), the method that achieved an automated translation from high dimension  motion feature to a discrete categorised sequence for quantified hand motion evaluation. The proposed skeleton-based behaviour quantification method has great potential in hand behaviour analysis, it paves the way for future use in ASD diagnosis and intervention.
